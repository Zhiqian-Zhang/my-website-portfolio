          <h2>My Background</h2>
          <p>
            As you may notice from my undergraduate degree, I am new to the
            field of computer science and had no coding knowledge or experience
            before starting grad school. However, I have extensive research,
            clinical, leadership, and volunteering experiences that have shaped
            me into a tenacious learner and inquisitive thinker, who always
            seeks to unravel the question, "why?"

      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>
        Although I have shifted away from pursuing a career as a medical doctor,
        I view each of my past experiences as invaluable building blocks. Every
        class, job, and encounter within the healthcare field has played an
        instrumental role in shaping the person I've become today. As I embark
        on my journey in computer science, I am eager to combine these
        experiences to have a broader skillset. My overarching aspiration is to
        contribute to the field of healthcare technology, with a strong focus on
        enhancing accessibility and medical literacy, particularly within rural
        and underserved communities.

      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Originally on a rigorous pre-med track, I realized that while I would
        enjoy practicing medicine, I was always ambivalent about my future
        goals. After working as a scribe in the Emergency Department, I directly
        witnessed both the positive and negative impacts of technology: a
        well-formed Emergency Medical Records (EMR) system can save a life, but
        a poor working interface can take time away from direct patient care.
        This solidified my desire to gain expertise in computer science and
        integrate this knowledge with my background in healthcare to increase
        accessibility through improved medical interfaces. What interests me the
        most about computer science is the ability to build the backbone of
        systems of the future that can bridge the gap in patient care and
        improve access to quality diagnoses for millions around the world. For
        healthcare to be universal, governments, tech agencies, and
        organizations have to collaborate, coordinate, and understand people for
        changes to occur at the patient level. This is my motivation for going
        into computer science: to make sure each patient is receiving the most
        effective and conducive care.
